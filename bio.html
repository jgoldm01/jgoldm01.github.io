<p>This is my bio. I am Jeremy Goldman SON OF MICHAEL GOLDMAN, HEIR TO THE SEVEN KINGDOMS</p>

<p class="backstory"> I come from the town of columbia, Maryland. Well, I was originally born in manhattan, but I don't remember any of it. Though I'm sure it shaped my rapidly forming baby mind in ways I'll never understand. Columbia is a pleasant place, good bike paths, parks, and little forests dotting the perfectly planned out suburbia. </p>
<p class="backstory"> From a very young age I was interested in strategy and tactics. Like most children from the 90s, I played pokemon, but I was much more academic in my enjoyment of the game -- I studied the stats, calculated the damage that each move would do in battles, and chose my team accordingly. This was what I did for fun; that, and host knex jousting tournaments. I also played sports and ran around a lot; you know, kid stuff. </p>
<p class="dark"> Then came the dark ages: middle school. worst of all, it was middle school in the early 2000s, which was for all intents and purposes basically the nineties. Being a nerd was not yet cool; the popular musicians of our day (in hollywood as well as in my class) were in bands. Angsty little bands where instrumentation was limited to the crude guitar and drums. Music producers our age were few and far between -- kids these days are very lucky. </p>
<p class="light"> High school and college were better. Significantly better. Like, WAAAAAAAAAaaaaAAAAyyyyy better. Now I just kinda chill around, do work, play piano, code. God, I love coding. so good. like, dont get me wrong, I have other hobbies, but I can't imagine what I would be doing if computer science wasn't a thing. Probably the military, not gonna lie. </p>
<p class="explination"> you're all probably wondering, 'well how does this make you the rightful heir to the iron throne?'. It doesn't really. I have vague connections to leif Erikson, but thats about it. Really, what makes you king of Westeros is commanding great armies. Or being friends with people who command great armies. Or dragons; that'll do it. </p>
